Each semis/finals game will have a team of 4 statkeeping spotters positioned around the field who will radio stats into one statkeeper.  Statkeepers will need to check in to the staff tent no later than 15 minutes before the start time for training and so they can be in position 15 minutes before round start.

Scorekeeper (Semis/Finals),"Have the best possible seat for a game!  Your responsibilities would include:  keeping track of the score on the on-field scoreboard, texting score updates to tourney central, blowing game start/cap horns, and helping the statkeeper.

If you would like to keep for a specific division/team please note so in the request field in the sign-up.  If you would like to be paired with a friend (there is 1 stat and 1 scorekeeper per game) make the note in the request field and make sure your friend has signed up for the appropriate shift. 

IMPORTANT: If you have not yet received training on how to keep stats, then you need to arrive 30 minutes before the scheduled start time.

If you volunteer as statkeeper/scorekeeper it would be great (but not required) if you could please sign up for a minimum of 2 games.
